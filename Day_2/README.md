# Tip calculator
**If you go to a restaurant with your friends, it is usually cumbersome to have to do the math to know how much each person gets, not taking into account the tip. So I've created a fantastic calculator that helps you divide and bill, taking into account things like tip and number of people.**

* Dependencies:
	* Python 3.0 or higher

Execution:
> In your terminal, type the following: python main.py

> Or alternatively write python3 main.py
